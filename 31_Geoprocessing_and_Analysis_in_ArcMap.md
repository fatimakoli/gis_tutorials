# Premise

*We are interested at looking at access to daycare centers accross NYC. First, we will determine the percent of daycare centers in NYC that are in areas with high concentrations of children under 5 years old. Then, we will evaluate which daycare centers are farthest from 
public transportation (subway stations). Finally, we want to find out how many children under 5 are served by daycare centers that are "far" away from subway stations.*

# Deliverable

A map showing a buffer around daycares that are 1/4 miles or more away from a subway station.

**Answer the following three questions:**

* What percent of daycare centers are located in areas (i.e. tracts) with high concentrations of children under 5?
* What percent of daycare centers in NYC are located farther than 1/4 mile away from a subway station? 
* How many children under 5, total, do those "far" daycare centers serve? (and, when you find this answer, include 1-2 sentences reflecting on whether this seems like a large number or not - and explain how you would know whether it's a large or small number)

# Data and Preparation

Download the data (in a future ab, you will see how the day care centers shapefile was created from a csv of addresses):

* [Day Care Centers](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/Day%20Care%20Center.zip)
      **NOTE**: You will have to rename the layer "DaycareCenters" in the Catalog window once you open ArcMap.
* [NYC_TRACTS_2010](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/2010Tracts-20191025T194412Z-001.zip). 
      **NOTE**: You will have to rename the layer TRACTS in the Catalog window once you open ArcMap.
* [UnderFivePopulation](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/UnderFivePopulation.xls). **NOTE**: You may have to save this file as a CSV after downloading it.
* [Subway Stations](https://github.com/alisaalias/gis_tutorials/blob/alisaalias-patch-1/data/Subway%20Stations.zip)
     **NOTE**: You will have to rename the layer SubwayStations in the Catalog window once you open ArcMap.


**SET A PROJECTED COORDINATE SYSTEM IN ADVANCE.** The projection for this lab will matter as we will be calculating area, which is only possible/accurate when calculated in a projected coordinate system. Right-click the data frame (the white space where you would typically see the map in ArcMap), select `Data Frame Properties...` > `Coordinate System` (tab). Search for or nvaigate to `NAD 1983 State Plane NY Long Island` (feet or meters, but just remember which one you selected and use that going forward!). Select that projection and click `Apply`, then `OK`. 

Add the three shapefiles (transform them to the projected coordinate system as you add them!!) and the table to the data frame/table of contents.

**Join** the`TRACTS` shapefile to the `UnderFivePopulation` table.

**Note:** Save your map project (as a .mxd) periodically. Also, we will be creating **many** new layers/shapefiles in this lab and will need to save them all in the same folder. As you create these new shapefiles, we encourage you to explore their geometries - open the attribute tables and think about what each record looks like in space and where it is located.

**Finding daycares near concentrations of children under 5**

How many daycares (or what percent of the total number of daycares) are located within census tracts where more than 15.5% of the population are children under five years old?

* Navigate to menu `Selection` > `Select by Attributes`. Make sure the `TRACTS` layer is the active selection and the selection method is set to `Create a New Selection`. **Double-click** `UFiveP`, click `>`, and type `15.5`. Your expression should look like this:
`"UFiveP" > 15.5`. Click `OK`. In the bottom left-hand corner of the ArcMap window, you should see how many features were selected.

* Right-click on the TRACTS layer and choose `Selection` > `Create Layer from Selected Features`. A new layer will appear on top. Save (`Export`) that new layer to your working directory (e.g. `Daycare_Lab` folder) as a shapefile called `NYC_tracts_kids`. Clear selection by navigating to menu item `Selection` > `Clear selected feautres`. Remove the duplicate TRACTS selection layer. Open the attribute table of the `NYC_Tracts_Kids` layer and skim through the data. Note the areas where there are high concentrations of children - is there a pattern? 

Resymbolize the `NYC_tracts_kids` layer so that you can see it clearly over the original `TRACTS` layer. Arrange the layers so that subway stations and daycares are the top two layers.

* We will determine which daycare centers lie within these census tracts by using the select by location tool. Navigate to menu item `Selection` > `Select by location...`. Set the target layer to `DaycareCenters` and the source layer to `NYC_tracts_kids`. Set the selection methods for target layer features to `are within the source layer feature` and click `OK`.

(Note that you don't have to create a new shapefile to be able to do this selection. After you'd selected census tracts where more than 15.5% of the population are children under five years old, yoou could have gone to the Select by Location tool and checked off the option under Source Layer to `Use selected features`. Then it would only check the spatial relationship for those selected features.) 

* Open the attribute table of `DaycareCenters` to see how many day care centers were selected. What percent of the total number of daycare centers fall within these tracts (divide the selected number by the total and multiply that number by 100)?

**Save** your map project.

Now we will turn to the question regarding the relationship between subway stations and daycare centers in NYC: How many daycare centers are located farther than 1/4 mile away from a subway station? 

To answer this question, we will create a 1/4 mile buffer around daycare centers. We will be saving a number of new layers so make
sure to save everything in the same folder in your working directory.

# Creating buffers

* Navigate to menu item `Selection` > `Clear Selected Features` to deselect the daycare centers.
* Navigate to menu item `Geoprocessing` > `Buffer`.
* Set Input Features to `SubwayStations` - this sets which layer the buffers will draw around.
* Set the Output Feature Class to `Subways_QuarterMiBuffer.shp` within your working directory.
* Set the buffer distance to 0.25 and set the unit to miles.
* Click `OK`. 

Next we will use the select by location tool to determine which daycare centers fall within ¼ mile of a subway station. Navigate to menu item `Selection` > `Select by location...`.

* Set Target Layer to `DaycareCenters` and Source Layer to `Subways_QuarterMiBuffer`. Make sure to use the `intersect the source layer feature` selection method for target layer features.
* Click `OK`.
* Open the attribute table of `DaycareCenters`. The selections show how many daycare centers are WITHIN a 1/4 mile of a subway station.
In order to determine how many fall outside the 1/4 distance, subtract the number of selections from the total number of daycare centers. Convert that number into a percent to answer Question #2.

# Spatial Join and Making Estimates

In order to answer our final question regarding the percent of children under five served by daycare centers "far" away from subway stations, we will need to perform a spatial join.

* Deselect the daycare centers by navigating to `Selection` > `Clear Selected Features`. 
* Uncheck the box next to the `Subways_QuarterMiBuffer` layer so that it is not visible on the map.
* Create a quarter mile buffer around the daycare centers (`Geoprocessing` > `Buffer`, input features are daycare centers, save the output feature class as `Daycares_QuarterMiBuffer`, set the distance to 0.25 Miles and click `OK`).
* Right-click on the `Daycares_QuarterMiBuffer` layer and select `Joins and Relates` > `Join...`
* Choose `Join data from another layer based on a spatial location` from the drop-down menu.
* Choose `SubwayStations` as the layer to join to this layer.
* Since we just want to know which daycare centers are farther than 1/4 mile from a subway station, we don't necessarily need to compute 
a summary, so don't check any of those boxes.
* Save the output shapefile in your working directory as `Daycares_QuarterMiBuffer_SubwaysJoin`
* Click `OK`.

Right-click on the new layer, `Daycares_QuarterMiBuffer_SubwaysJoin`, and open the attribute table. The `count` field tells us how many subway stations are within the 1/4 buffer of each daycare center. Pause for 30 seconds here to explore the attribute table and see how the spatial join works. Select the features in this layer that have a 0 as their record in the `count` field. Add the selected features to the map as a new layer. Save/export that layer as a shapefile called `Daycares_NoSubways` and add it to the map. Remove the selections copy of `Daycares_QuarterMiBuffer_SubwaysJoin` and clear selections.

How many children under 5 are served by these daycare centers (i.e. how many children under 5 live near these daycare centers)?

We will estimate the population of children under 5 that live precisely within our ¼ mile buffers using
a method called proportional split estimation. A proportional split is a way to estimate the proportion of a 
quantitative attribute that falls within a portion of a polygon’s area. A proportional split is calculated in a few fairly simple steps.

We calculate the area of each polygon unit:
* Clip the polygons to the boundary of the study area (in our case the ¼ mile buffers)
* Calculate the area of the polygons after clipping them to the study area
* Divide the area of the polygons within the study area by their original area to determine the proportion of the original area that falls within the study area
* Multiply the attributes (for us, population of children under 5) we wish to estimate by the proportion in order to estimate the proportion of the attribute that falls within the study area. 
Note: that proportional split estimation assumes that the attribute you are estimating is evenly distributed through out the polygon. 
In reality the population within each census tract is not evenly distributed nevertheless thus this is an estimate.

**Calculating the area of the census tracts**

* Open the attribute table for the TRACTS layer and click the “Table Options” icon and choose Add Field. Name the field Area, of type Double. Click OK.
* Right-Click on the Area field and choose Calculate Geometry. Ignore warnings. Set the Property to `Area`, the units to `Square Miles`, and click `OK`. 

**Clipping the census tracts to the ¼ mile `Daycares_NoSubways` buffers**

* Next we will use the clip tool to clip the tracts with the ¼ mile buffers around the Daycare centers that are not near a subway station
* Navigate to `Geoprocessing` > `Clip`.
* Set the Input Features to TRACTS.
* Set the Clip Features to Daycares_NoSubways.
* Save the Output Feature Class as `Tracts_Daycares_NoSubways_Clip.shp`. Click `OK`.

A new layer containing the census tracts clipped to the ¼ mile buffers around the daycares was added to your map.
Toggle the visibility of all of the layers on your map off except for `Tracts_Daycares_NoSubways_Clip`.

# Calculating the area of the clipped census tracts

* Now we will calculate the area of these new polygons.
* Open the attribute table for the clipped census tracts layer: `Tracts_Daycares_NoSubways_Clip`
* Create a new field again to calculate the new area of each polygon.
* Name the field `AreaClip`, of type Double. Click `OK`.
* Notice the new field that has been added to the far right of the attribute table called `AreaClip`. Right-Click on `AreaClip` and choose `Calculate Geometry`. Set the Property to `Area`, units to `Square Miles`, and click `OK`.

# Dividing the area of the clipped census tracts by their original area

* With the attribute table still open, add a new field.
* Name the field `Proportion`, of type Double.
* Right-Click on the new field `Proportion` and choose `Field Calculator....` Ignore warnings.
* Double-click `AreaClip`, Click `/` sign, and double-click `TRACTS_Area` (`TRACTS_AREA` might have been shortened to just `TRACTS_Are`). Your calculation should look like this: `[AreaClip]/[TRACTS_Area]` -- i.e. the proportion of the original area that remained after the clip.
* Click `OK`

# Multiplying the population by the proportion

* Create a new geodatabase called `DaycareLab` in your working directory (e.g. `Daycare_Lab_2` folder).
* Now we will calculate one final field where we’ll multiply the attributes in order to estimate the proportion of the attribute that falls within the study area.
* Add a new field and name it `UF_cl` of type Double.
* Right-Click on the new field `UF_cl` and choose `Field Calculator....` Ignore warnings.
* Double-click `Proportion`, click `*` sign, and double-click `TotUnderFive` (if you can't find `TotUnderFive` in the list of fields, use `UnderFiv_4`). Your calculation should look like this: `[Proportion] * [TotUnderFive]`. (or, possibly, `[Proportion] * [UnderFiv_4]`
* Click `OK`
* Close the attribute table.

Navigate to `Geoprocessing` > `ArcToolbox` > `Analysis Tools` > `Statistics` > `Summary Statistics`. 
Set the Input Table to `Tracts_Daycares_NoSubways_Clip`. Save the Output Table to `Tracts_cl_Stats` in the `Daycarelab` geodatabase. 
Set the Statistics Field to `UF_cl` and Statistics Type to `SUM`. Click OK.

Open the new table to get the estimated total number of children under 5 in the clipped areas (i.e. the areas where there are
daycare centers that are all more than 1/4 mile away from a subway station). This is the answer to question 3.
